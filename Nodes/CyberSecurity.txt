{
CIA (Confidentual Integrity and avalibilyti) -  it information security triad
Confidentiality: it meen that in this information only have accses to the information and it meen that data will protected from unautorized person.

Integrity: it about accuracy and integrity data it meenns that data cant change unautorithed person

Availability: is ensure that information or data are accessible to autorized user. Thim meen that mainating the system and give relaible access to thr data.

Acces data
And protecting against disruption system for i can get acces to the systen 24/7.

{
Demetria and asymmetric encription:

Symmetric encryption use single key for enncriptr and decrypt data

Asymmetric use 2 ket one for encrypt and the second for decrypt.
}

{
Help protect thread in the network and dectivire them
}

{
IDS and IPS:
IDS is only for alerts
IPS is fore react on the shared
}



OSI Rapid:

7 : Application: this layer are allow that program running on my commuter.
6 : Presentation: I get the data from the application and recharge the format which understend the computer
5 : Session: after the receiving the correct format data, and session allow to connect with other computer across the network, it allow do multiple request on different endpoint, its like when I open the many tabs in one moment
4 Transport: its the layer were the data will transmitted for this use the 2 protocol (TCP/UDP) 
TCP are are more distracted protocol because he check the packed which the recive and need that all packedges are get if not will Waite on this packages
UDP: in this time the recive all packages I doesn't mether it can work without the waiting when can get all packedgs and its why UDP are more fasted then TCP 

3 Network: this layer are responsible for locating the destination of the request, in this time the destination is the IP address were will be requested the data I can communicate in this layer I can use IPV4 or IPV6
2 Data Link: this layer are focused on the physical addresssing transition it receive the packets from the network layer that include the IP and add to this MAC. When the information is send to the network it actual address use for identify where exactly was send the information and check the receiving data
1 Physical transformation data understendet format the jog of physical layer os to convert the binary data of the transmission into the signal.

[Editing topic
4 layer: choose the send data over TCP or UDP
2 layer: he check receiving data to make sure that all correct
2 layer: also use for preparation format for transmitted
1 layer: can receive and transmit data
6 layer: this layer encrypt compress, (give the standarith format)
5 layer: check the communication between host and receiver 
7 layer: accept communication request from application
3 layer: is the my logical address
4 layer: UDP best for video communication

My uderstending why actually need the OSI model is use for how data is trasmitet toroth the network from the view (what I see on the my computer) to the binary code to translate this the computer and it releted with different computer in the network.

Encapsulation:
Defenition: is add the headers to data it very import he ca help to (error detection, and protocol handling, and ensuring that delivered from the sours to destination correctly)

In this version will see a some changes:
DATA: 7,6,5
Segments:4
Packets: 3
Frames: 2
Bits:1
 
If the message are received on the second computer it reverses the process but now it start from the physical layer and working until the reached the application


[
TCP/IP model:
Its very similar with the OSSI model but in this time he have 4 layer:

4 layer: Application
3 layer: Transport
2 layer: Internet
1 Network Interface

My understanding TCP?IP ethnic difference is three-way handshake it means that I need to form connection between two commuter this process named: three way handshake.

Diagnostic tools:
[
Ping: 
Its the command is use for the test connection with remote resource usual it can be the website the ping use ICMP protocol (use for reporting the error and diagnostic the network)
Syntax command: ping google.com
This allow to understand the connection and return the IP
]

[
Traceroute:
This command for diagnostic use for is use for track the path from the sours to the destination actress the IP network. It very helpful identify route the data for rich their destination
