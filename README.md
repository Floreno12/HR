To successfully install Sepio QueryTool, please follow these steps in your Linux Ubuntu terminal:

Make the installer script executable by running the following command:

chmod +x Sepio_QueryTool_installer.sh
Execute the installer script:

./Sepio_QueryTool_installer.sh
This will start the installation process, which will download and install all necessary components and dependencies into your directory and run the latest build of the app.

If you accidentally shut down the application running on port 3000, you can use the Run_Sepio_QT.sh script to restart the app without reinstalling it.
